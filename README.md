#Pump Automation and Control Device
Overview
This project involves the design and development of a pump automation and control device using NodeMCU with custom firmware. The device features a custom control board with buttons for manual/auto mode switching and pump on/off functionality, LED indicators, and an ultrasonic sensor for water level monitoring. It is integrated with the Blynk platform for IoT connectivity and remote monitoring.

Features
Manual/Auto Mode Switching: Toggle between manual and automatic operation modes using a dedicated button.
Pump On/Off Control: Control the pump operation with a separate on/off button.
LED Indicators: Visual feedback for mode status and pump operation.
Water Level Monitoring: Ultrasonic sensor to measure and monitor water levels in real-time.
Remote Monitoring and Control: Blynk integration for IoT connectivity, allowing remote monitoring and control via the Blynk app.

Installation
Hardware Setup
Connect the NodeMCU to the custom control board.
Wire the buttons to the appropriate GPIO pins on the NodeMCU.
Connect the LED indicators to the designated GPIO pins.
Interface the ultrasonic sensor with the NodeMCU.
Connect the relay module to the pump and NodeMCU for control.
Firmware Setup
Install the Arduino IDE from Arduino website.
Install the ESP8266 Board Package in the Arduino IDE.
Install the following libraries:
Blynk
NewPing (for ultrasonic sensor)
Open the provided PumpControl.ino sketch in Arduino IDE.
Configure the Blynk credentials in the sketch.
Upload the sketch to the NodeMCU.
Blynk Setup
Download the Blynk app from Google Play Store or Apple App Store.
Create a new project in the Blynk app.
Add the necessary widgets (buttons, LEDs, level display) and link them to the virtual pins defined in the sketch.
Use the authentication token from the Blynk app in your Arduino sketch.
Usage
Power on the NodeMCU.
Use the mode switch button to toggle between manual and automatic modes.
In manual mode, the pump can be turned on or off using the pump control button.
In automatic mode, the pump operation is controlled based on water level readings from the ultrasonic sensor.
Monitor and control the device remotely using the Blynk app.
